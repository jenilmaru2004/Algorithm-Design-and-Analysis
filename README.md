• Collaborated with a 3-person team to design and implement graph algorithms and data structures, including sorting algorithms, graph traversals, Red-Black Trees, and shortest-path algorithms like Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, and A*. Conducted empirical analysis to compare algorithmic performance based on time complexity, graph density, and heuristic accuracy, with outputs visualized through plots and benchmarks.

• Developed a dynamic graph visualization tool and explored real-world datasets (e.g., London Subway Network) to apply and assess algorithms, demonstrating scalability and robustness.
